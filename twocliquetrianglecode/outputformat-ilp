optimum;int(bestBound) (if the ILP finished within the timelimit the optimal value is written, otherwise [lb, ub] gives a lower bound (lb) and and upper bound (ub) for the solution])
totCPU (total time used by the algorithm)
timeCplex (total time used by CPLEX)
tc (percentage of time used in callbacks)
dens (density of solution)
gmin (minmal degree in solution)
gmax (maximal degree in solution)
a_cluster (alpha-cluster of a connected graph is a value such that all nodes have a  "local clustering coefficient">=alpha)
numCallbackCalls
numLazzyCutsInserted
wiener (Wiener Index)
timePreproc (time needed for preprocessing, that is, removing vertices in too few trinagles)
prePro (three possible values: 'timeout' if the ILP did not finish within the timelimit, '0' if graph is empty after the preprocessigng phase, and '1' otherwise)
